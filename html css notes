img src="hq.img"
used to insert images in html
when we adjust width of image, height also changes

object-position: top/bottom/left/right;
to position the image within the given h/w
object-fit:contain;
to contain the image within given height/width

<input> is a void element
<input type="text"> will give us a textbox
<input type="check
placeholder attribute acts as a text that guides a user what to do and guides its value

block elements take an entire line
ex- <p>

inline-block element takes only the desired space

inline element appears within a line of text

if we wanna display same style in diff elements we can use comma 

.boxraw,
.bw {
    display: inline-block;
}


<div> is an element that acts as a container for other elements 
in order to build complex real world websites we need containers and div is the perfect solution to this problem
As it can be used to contain other elements


To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element:

Example
.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
}

divs have width of 100% so if we want our elements on webpage next to each other we need to decrease the width of 
the divs

to round an image we set the border-radius and widthh and adjust it

when we set grid-template-coloumns to 1fr the space bw inline block element disappears

display:grid for displaying a div as grid
grid-template-coloumns: for how much spacce the grid takes
coloumn-gap & row-gap for gaps bw coloumns and rows
